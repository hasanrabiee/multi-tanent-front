#  Multi-Tenant Frontend (Next.js)

This repository contains the frontend built with **Next.js** for the Brink Multi-Tenant application. It is designed to work alongside the backend built with **Laravel**. The frontend handles tenant-specific features, user authentication, and post management through API interactions with the Laravel backend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js (>=14.x)**
- **NPM/Yarn** (for managing frontend dependencies)

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building static and server-rendered web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for designing a responsive UI.

## Features

### Multi-Tenancy

- Subdomain-based tenant management.
- Tenant-specific routing and API calls based on the tenantâ€™s subdomain.

### Authentication

- Allows user registration and login under specific tenants.
- Admin roles can be assigned to users with specific permissions for managing tenant resources.

### Post Management
